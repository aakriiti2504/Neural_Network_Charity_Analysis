## Overview

## Background
Tex is a data scientist and programmer for the non-profit foundation, 'Alphabet Soup'. They are full enthropic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, improve people's well being and unify the world. Alphabet Soup has raised and donated over 10 billion dollars in the past 20 years. This money has been used to invest in life saving technologies and organize reforce station groups around the world . bex is responsible for data collection and anlaysis for the entire organization. Her job is to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. This helps ensure that the foundation money is being used effectively. Unfortunately, not every donation that the company makes is impactful. In some cases an organization will take the money and disappear. As a result, the president of 'Alphabet Soups' Andy Glad, has asked Bex to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which ones are high risk. He wants her to create a mathematical data driven solution that can do this accurately. Bex has this idea that this problem is too complex for the statistical and machine learning models that she has used. Instead she will design and train a deep learning neural network. This model will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision making result. I am going to help Bex learn about Neural Networks and
